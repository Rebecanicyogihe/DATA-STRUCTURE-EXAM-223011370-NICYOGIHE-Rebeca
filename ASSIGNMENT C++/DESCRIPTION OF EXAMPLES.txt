Explanation about different main.cpp( C++ Language) 
Expanation for example 1
1. #include <iostream>
This is a preprocessor directive that includes the input-output stream library.
It allows the use of cout (to print messages to the screen) and cin (to take user input).
2. using namespace std;
This tells the compiler to use the standard namespace, making it easier to use cout and cin without writing std::cout or std::cin.
3. int main()
The main function is where the execution of the program starts.
Every C++ program must have a main() function.
4. return 0;
This statement indicates successful execution of the program.
Returning 0 means the program ended without errors.

Data Types and Variables
Variables store values in memory.
Variable names cannot contain special characters or spaces.
C++ is case-sensitive (Age is different from age).
Every variable must have a data type.
Common Data Types in C++
Data TypeDescriptionExampleintInteger numbers (whole numbers)int age = 25;floatDecimal numbers (single precision)float height = 5.9;doubleDecimal numbers (double precision)double pi = 3.14159;boolBoolean values (true/false)bool isRaining = false;charSingle characterchar grade = 'A';
Explanation for example 3
Cin: Taking Input from the User
To accept user input, we use cin.
cout << ? Displays output on the screen.
Explanation for example 4
Operators in C++
Operators allow us to perform calculations and make decisions in a program.
Arithmetic Operators
OperatorOperationExample (a = 10, b = 5)Result+Additiona + b15-Subtractiona - b5*Multiplicationa * b50/Divisiona / b2%Modulus (Remainder)a % b0
Corrections in Your Text:
Subtraction operator: 
Incorrect: "_" used for substraction
Correct: "-" used for subtraction
Cin Explanation: 
Instead of: "Cin >> take input from user, this ask user to write anything on their screen."
It should be: "cin >> is used to take input from the user and store it in a variable."
